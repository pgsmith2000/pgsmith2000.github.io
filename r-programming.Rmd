I love programming in R. I know python too, but I enjoy R a bit more, because I tend to think like a statistician. And R matches that a little better. Here are a few of the portfolio (demonstration) projects I am working on:

- [Revisiting the Cross-Sectional Association Between Missing Teeth and Cardiovascular Disease: BRFSS 2018](https://pgsmith2000.github.io/cvd-and-teeth/)

- [Sample Descriptive Analysis Using Publicly Available Healthcare Data (BRFSS 2018 Data)](https://github.com/pgsmith2000/BRFSS/)

- [Daily information summary of economic indicators available from FRED, FRB St. Louis](https://github.com/pgsmith2000/dailyecon/)

- [Analyses with Data from Biostatistics With R by Babak Shahbaba](https://github.com/pgsmith2000/biostatistics/)
